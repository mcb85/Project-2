# Project-2
The Full Spectrum app creates a forum for families of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Users have the ability to communicate and share ideas with other families, discuss important issues, as well as access resources and events in the community. While this is a free website for families, a user account must be created to access the website. 

## Instructions
To run the app, the user will go to https://fullspectrum1.herokuapp.com/ in the browser. This will direct them to the main page. If the user is visiting for the first time, they will click on the sign-up button to create a new user. The user will then sign-in using their email address and password. If user has already created an account, they will bypass the first step. After user is authenticated, they will be redirected to the blog page. Here they can create blog posts. Posts are displayed in the form of a list on the page. The user will also have access to an events calendar page, where they can view events, as well as a resources page.
